Note on changing themes 
========================

If you're playing with the themes, then we request you to please take care of following points

- Work off a git branch
- Generate the site on your desktop, publish it somewhere else and submit URL for feedback. 
- If the group feels the new look is better we'll merge the branch onto the master

With UI its just too easy to be flip-flopping and have n opinions with no sound basis to actually discuss them. So lets set the above as a base rule for making changes to UI.
