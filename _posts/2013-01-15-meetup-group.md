We've created the [PythonPune Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune) to coordinate and announce meetings and events run by PythonPune. The [first meetup of the year](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/98540482/) has already been put up there.

In keeping with this objective, we urge members to signup to Meetup.com (absolutely free) and join the group so that they can register their interest in specific events and recieve announcements of new meetups and discussions thereof.
