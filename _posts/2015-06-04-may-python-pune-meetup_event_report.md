About 35 people attended the meetup. It had started around 10:45 A.M. with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) workshop by [Ankit Rana](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/members/69768862/).
He started with How a general web framework works, followed by:

- Installation of flask

- What is route and How it is used
- Database abstraction layers

During the workshop, [Kushal Das](http://kushaldas.in/) explained the doubts of attendees related to flask and if __name__ == '__main__':

Around 12:50 P.M., [Narendra Petkar](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/members/158684872/) presented a talk on [robotframework](http://robotframework.org/) (generic test automation framework) written in Python.
He started with :

- Introduction to robotframework
- How to install and invoke it.
- How to write simple keyword driven, data driven tests.

To explain it, he had created a test scenario where the test can open Firefox, open an url and search for unable to connect keyword.

After a short break, we again started with [Excel Made Easy with Python using Pandas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8YXqyJ4f0BhRTY2aFZZMGZpWlpjaDUwLUs2ZzJKR1VicmpZ/view?usp=sharing) by [Sudarshan Gadhave](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/members/178709522). He started with basics of python, followed by introduction to pandas, then he had taken a excel data set of Titanic Passengers to perform operations using pandas like reading an excel file, taking out specific data and representing it, perform selection on those data based on column names, filtering it and adding a new column. He also explained how we can join two excel files and how to plots graphs based on extracted data.

Finally, the meetup ended by 02:30 P.M.
We planned to continue the flask workshop in next meetup and with some more new awesome talks.
