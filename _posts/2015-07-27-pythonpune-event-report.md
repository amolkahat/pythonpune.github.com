July [Python Pune](http://pune.python.org.in/meeting-notes/2015/06/04/may-python-pune-meetup_event_report.html) Developer's sprint, was conducted at RedHat Pune office on 25th July 2015. This was the second developer sprint of the Python Pune to encourage developers to contribute to upstream projects written in Python.
The projects selected for sprint were listed here on [gist](https://gist.github.com/chkumar246/771fc9f5a571d43c80bc).

Aim of the developer's sprint:

- Help people new to OSS, understand contribution process.
- Encourage new developers to contribute to OSS projects.
- Spark a start of new innovative python projects.
- Motivate more community interaction.


The sprint started at 10 a.m. with people starting to select the projects they like. Apart from the major projects [Chandan](https://twitter.com/ciypro) also suggested some projects to start from scratch, which are enlisted in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/chkumar246/771fc9f5a571d43c80bc) in ideas section. 

[Tejas Sathe](https://twitter.com/sathetejas) presented his own Python project of creating a git like public repository for storing large data sets needed to do data analysis. And inception of his project happened over there. Those people who liked the idea contributed to project.

[I](http://twitter.com/surajssd009005) was mentoring on a project for the first time. Last developer's sprint [I](https://deshmukhsuraj.wordpress.com/) was a new to all this stuff. I was working on the project called [Scapy](https://bitbucket.org/secdev/scapy/wiki/Home) and was mentoring the same.

Folks kept working till 4.30 p.m. and finally we had a [group photo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKwyLr7UcAAlEzA.jpg). Thanks Chandan and RedHat for conducting and hosting this sprint once again.
