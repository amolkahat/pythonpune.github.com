[PythonPune](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/) successfully completed 9th iteration of meetup on 29th August, since its reboot in December 2014. [August month meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/224686182/) was held at [Amazatic Solutions, Pune](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Office+%23+712%2C+713+%26+716+Spot+18+Mall%2C+Jagtap+Dairy+Chowk%2C+Pimple+Saudagar+%2C+Pune%2C+in).


Meetup started with introduction of PythonPune community by [Chandan Kumar](https://twitter.com/ciypro/). Also he talked about upcoming events that are gonna happen in Python India community like upcoming [Pycon India 2015](https://in.pycon.org/2015/) is the next big event. 


Then [I](https://twitter.com/surajssd009005) conducted workshop on **[Scapy](https://bitbucket.org/secdev/scapy/wiki/Home)**. I started with what [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/index.html) is and how its flexible relative to other networking tools. And then it was a hands on session.

Next was a talk from [Dhriti Shikhar](https://twitter.com/DhritiShikhar) on **How I started contributing to Fedora-infra**. She talked about the Fedora-infrastructural project called [Pagure](https://pagure.io/pagure).

She started with the explanation of the project, what it is, how it is being implemented, similarities between Pagure and Github. Then she explained how one can get started with Fedora-infra projects. After that she shown how one can contribute to Pagure by doing a demonstration of solving a bug and sending a pull request. Following is her presentation

Finally was a talk from [Anshul Behl](https://twitter.com/anshul_behl) on **Creating your own test libraries for robot framework**. He took a simple Flask webapp and shown how test cases are written using RobotFramework. Further in the demo he shown how easy it is for someone who knows your project but not to technical level to write test cases for your app.

height="400" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px">

And how its so human readable, that you type simple English format to write test cases in Robot. Also generating test reports in a nice web dashboard. Here is the link to the [git repo](https://github.com/anshulbehl/pune_python_meetup) he used.


At last was a general discussion about upcoming meetup and what all improvements could be made to the meetup the way it is held. Then there was announcement from Chandan about the upcoming meetup which is gonna be a mix of Workshop and Developer's sprint, so it involves how to get involved in project like [Kuma](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma), which powers [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). Date is yet to be announced so stay tuned to the [PythonPune Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pythonpune).
