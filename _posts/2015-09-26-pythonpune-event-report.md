[PythonPune](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/) [September meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/225424060/) was conducted at [Walnut](http://getwalnut.com) on 26th September.

Meetup started with workshop on **IPython-Notebook** by [me](https://twitter.com/surajssd009005). I explained what [IPython](http://ipython.org/) and [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) are, the basic layout and usage of notebook, architecture of IPython, various basic usages of IPython, features of IPython, additional things that default python interpreter does not provide, etc.

Further also discussed how IPython has been transformed into a language agnostic tool and now is renamed as **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)**. The workshop was from *Programmer's perspective*, IPython Notebook as a learning, documentation and teaching tool, rather than a *Data scientist perspective*(Data scientist exclusively use IPython-Notebook for graphical and visual representation).

Then was short talk by [Chandan Kumar](https://twitter.com/ciypro/) on **[Stay Updated with python programming Language](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/meetup_notes)**. He explained solution to a problem which every *Python programmer* has faced, as a matter of fact every programmer has faced this issue, when you learn any language you are transitioning from beginner to intermediate to advanced, at every stage what should you do to go to next higher stage? He mentioned books to read, places to ask questions, python related video tutorials, importance of meetups and conferences and contributing to open source projects.
