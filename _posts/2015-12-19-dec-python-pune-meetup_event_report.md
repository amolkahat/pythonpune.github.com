[December Python Pune meetup 2015](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/227265006/) was held at [Castalia Labs, Pune (India)](http://castalialabs.com/) on 19th Dec, 2015.
It was a full day workshop on Computer Vision - Playing with Camera and Images using Python.
Around 15-20 people attended this meetup.

The workshop was divided into small topics followed by a series of small tasks.

Before the start of the workshop, the following packages needs to be installed:

* opencv
* numpy

Finally, [Jemshid](https://twitter.com/KakeJemshid) started the workshop with the introduction of Opencv and explained:

* Read a photo from webcam and display it.
* Read an image in terms of pixels stored as a multi-dimensional numpy array.
* Understand the boolean logic over numpy array.
* Filtering the pixels by using RGB values.
* Filtering a particular object through grayscaling the images.
* Continuously capturing images and filtering them according to static filter applied and displaying it using matplotlib.
* Difference between Computer Vision and Image processing

Below is the list of tasks we performed:

* Read a photo from webcam and display it.
* Segment out green pixels from a yellow color.
* Filter ball only.
* See the captured result in a loop

At the end of the workshop, we have a general discussions around Open Source Python Projects and about upcoming meetups.
