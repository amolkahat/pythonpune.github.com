### _Note: This page is part of a set of pages still being evolved and thus under construction_

### What companies qualify

* Companies with development centers in Pune using Python, and
* Those who state (and we believe it likely to be true) have at least one full time developer working in/on/with python in Pune
* Note: usage of python could include using it to write test cases or system administration. Does not need to be coding only.

### What information to add about the company

* Some of the projects in python (especially for projects / services companies)
* Nature of product in python (especially for product / saas company)
* What python tools are used
* How is python used
* Any views / opinions about python
* Any python developers and their work you might want to refer to

### How should this information be filled

1. Ideally someone from the company should fill out this information (needs to be a markdown + git + pull request literate person) (Will publish a contact email address soon)
1. Else company can mail information to one of the pythonpune members who can enter it in .md format & issue a pull request
1. Else PythonPune members can add the information about known companies working with python and we can over a period of time replace the information with that received by the company (May be the best way to get started). When information is not provided by the company a link to a email-id/webform where a company can contact the webmasters for corrections must be provided.
